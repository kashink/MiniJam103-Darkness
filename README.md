Game for Mini Jam 103 -> Darkness (https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-103-darkness)

Numbness

When I was younger I always had a recurring dream where I lived in a maze because it seemed like a better life always having somewhere to hide where I could run and it would be much harder to be found and then I started creating my own doors in this maze, it was my labyrinth, it was dangerous and I thought I was in control of it but that had a cost.

Older, someone told me that the labyrinth represents life's journey, its obstacles, making the right choices, until we meet at the center... at home, a place to belong... but the journey there can make you feel numbness.

Notes:
The idea for this jam was to play with the concept of shooter games that the players spams the bullets to kill the monsters! So in this one you have infinite "bullets", but missing the target comes with a big increase in difficulty, so your aim and your impatience are your worst enemy!
