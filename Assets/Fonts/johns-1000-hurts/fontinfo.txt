Thanks for downloading one of my fonts! My fonts are free for non-commercial use... but donations are always accepted! Email me if you are interested in sending a donation. Of course you don't have to. If you want to use this font commercially, please contact me at one of the addresses above, and we'll talk about it... Okay? If you plan to use them non-commercially, the only thing that I ask is please let me know where you use them... I'm curious as to see how they'll look, because I'm new at this fontmaking stuff. You may distribute my fonts through any media, as long as you don't ask money for them and you don't claim them as your own. Other than that, do whatever you want! Also, check on the webpage every so often for any new fonts or new versions (although I don't plan on redoing any fonts unless I absolutely have to.) That's it!


"John's 1000 Hurts" was drawn by my boyfriend when we were listening to a record. We based the name of the font on the title of the record.
